	'B', 'Mining and quarrying', $$This section includes the extraction of minerals occurring naturally as solids (coal and ores), liquids (petroleum) or gases (natural gas). Extraction can be achieved by different methods such as underground or surface mining, well operation, seabed mining etc. This section also includes supplementary activities aimed at preparing the crude materials for marketing, for example, crushing, grinding, cleaning, drying, sorting, concentrating ores, liquefaction of natural gas and agglomeration of solid fuels. These operations are often carried out by the units that extracted the resource and/or others located nearby. Mining activities are classified into divisions, groups and classes on the basis of the principal mineral produced. Divisions 05, 06 are concerned with mining and quarrying of fossil fuels (coal, lignite, petroleum, gas); divisions 07, 08 concern metal ores, various minerals and quarry products. Some of the technical operations of this section, particularly related to the extraction of hydrocarbons, may also be carried out for third parties by specialized units as an industrial service, which is reflected in division 09. This section excludes the processing of the extracted materials (see section C - Manufacturing), which also covers the bottling of natural spring and mineral waters at springs and wells (see class 1104) or the crushing, grinding or otherwise treating certain earths, rocks and minerals not carried out in conjunction with mining and quarrying (see class 2399). This section also excludes the usage of the extracted materials without a further transformation for construction purposes (see section F - Construction), the collection, purification and distribution of water (see class 3600), separate site preparation activities for mining (see class 4312) and geophysical, geologic and seismic surveying activities (see class 7110).$$

	'C', 'Manufacturing',$$This section includes the physical or chemical transformation of materials, substances, or components into new products, although this cannot be used as the single universal criterion for defining manufacturing (see remark on processing of waste below). The materials, substances, or components transformed are raw materials that are products of agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining or quarrying as well as products of other manufacturing activities. Substantial alteration, renovation or reconstruction of goods is generally considered to be manufacturing. Units engaged in manufacturing are often described as plants, factories or mills and characteristically use power-driven machines and materials-handling equipment. However, units that transform materials or substances into new products by hand or in the worker's home and those engaged in selling to the general public of products made on the same premises from which they are sold, such as bakeries and custom tailors, are also included in this section. Manufacturing units may process materials or may contract with other units to process their materials for them. Both types of units are included in manufacturing. The output of a manufacturing process may be finished in the sense that it is ready for utilization or consumption, or it may be semi-finished in the sense that it is to become an input for further manufacturing. For example, the output of alumina refining is the input used in the primary production of aluminium; primary aluminium is the input to aluminium wire drawing; and aluminium wire is the input for the manufacture of fabricated wire products. Manufacture of specialized components and parts of, and accessories and attachments to, machinery and equipment is, as a general rule, classified in the same class as the manufacture of the machinery and equipment for which the parts and accessories are intended. Manufacture of unspecialized components and parts of machinery and equipment, e.g. engines, pistons, electric motors, electrical assemblies, valves, gears, roller bearings, is classified in the appropriate class of manufacturing, without regard to the machinery and equipment in which these items may be included. However, making specialized components and accessories by moulding or extruding plastics materials is included in class 2220. Assembly of the component parts of manufactured products is considered manufacturing. This includes the assembly of manufactured products from either self-produced or purchased components. The recovery of waste, i.e. the processing of waste into secondary raw materials is classified in class 3830 (Materials recovery). While this may involve physical or chemical transformations, this is not considered to be a part of manufacturing. The primary purpose of these activities is considered to be the treatment or processing of waste and they are therefore classified in Section E (Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities). However, the manufacture of new final products (as opposed to secondary raw materials) is classified in manufacturing, even if these processes use waste as an input. For example, the production of silver from film waste is considered to be a manufacturing process. Specialized maintenance and repair of industrial, commercial and similar machinery and equipment is, in general, classified in division 33 (Repair, maintenance and installation of machinery and equipment). However, the repair of computers and personal and household goods is classified in division 95 (Repair of computers and personal and household goods), while the repair of motor vehicles is classified in division 45 (Wholesale and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles). The installation of machinery and equipment, when carried out as a specialized activity, is classified in 3320. Remark: The boundaries of manufacturing and the other sectors of the classification system can be somewhat blurry. As a general rule, the activities in the manufacturing section involve the transformation of materials into new products. Their output is a new product. However, the definition of what constitutes a new product can be somewhat subjective. As clarification, the following activities are considered manufacturing in ISIC: - milk pasteurizing and bottling (see 1050) - fresh fish processing (oyster shucking, fish filleting), not done on a fishing boat (see 1020) - printing and related activities (see 1811, 1812) - ready-mixed concrete production (see 2395) - leather converting (see 1511) - wood preserving (see 1610) - electroplating, plating, metal heat treating, and polishing (see 2592) - rebuilding or remanufacturing of machinery (e.g. automobile engines, see 2910) - tyre retreading (see 2211) Conversely, there are activities that, although sometimes involving transformation processes, are classified in other sections of ISIC; in other words, they are not classified as manufacturing. They include: - logging, classified in section A (Agriculture, forestry and fishing); - beneficiating of agricultural products, classified in section A (Agriculture, forestry and fishing); - beneficiating of ores and other minerals, classified in section B (Mining and quarrying); - construction of structures and fabricating operations performed at the site of construction, classified in section F (Construction); - activities of breaking bulk and redistribution in smaller lots, including packaging, repackaging or bottling of products, such as liquors or chemicals; sorting of scrap; mixing of paints to customers' order; and cutting of metals to customers' order, producing a modified version of the same product, are classified to section G (Wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles).$$

Wholesaling and retailing are the final steps in the distribution of goods. Goods bought and sold are also referred to as merchandise. Also included in this section are the repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles. Sale without transformation is considered to include the usual operations (or manipulations) associated with trade, for example sorting, grading and assembling of goods, mixing (blending) of goods (for example sand), bottling (with or without preceding bottle cleaning), packing, breaking bulk and repacking for distribution in smaller lots, storage (whether or not frozen or chilled), cleaning and drying of agricultural products, cutting out of wood fibreboards or metal sheets as secondary activities. Division 45 includes all activities related to the sale and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles, while divisions 46 and 47 include all other sale activities. The distinction between division 46 (wholesale) and division 47 (retail sale) is based on the predominant type of customer. Wholesale is the resale (sale without transformation) of new and used goods to retailers, to industrial, commercial, institutional or professional users, or to other wholesalers, or involves acting as an agent or broker in buying goods for, or selling goods to, such persons or companies. The principal types of businesses included are merchant wholesalers, i.e. wholesalers who take title to the goods they sell, such as wholesale merchants or jobbers, industrial distributors, exporters, importers, and cooperative buying associations, sales branches and sales offices (but not retail stores) that are maintained by manufacturing or mining units apart from their plants or mines for the purpose of marketing their products and that do not merely take orders to be filled by direct shipments from the plants or mines. Also included are merchandise brokers, commission merchants and agents and assemblers, buyers and cooperative associations engaged in the marketing of farm products. Wholesalers frequently physically assemble, sort and grade goods in large lots, break bulk, repack and redistribute in smaller lots, for example pharmaceuticals; store, refrigerate, deliver and install goods, engage in sales promotion for their customers and label design. Retailing is the resale (sale without transformation) of new and used goods mainly to the general public for personal or household consumption or utilization, by shops, department stores, stalls, mail-order houses, door-to-door sales persons, hawkers and peddlers, consumer cooperatives, auction houses etc. Most retailers take title to the goods they sell, but some act as agents for a principal and sell either on consignment or on a commission basis.$$

The support activities included here are an integral part of the printing industry, and a product (a printing plate, a bound book, or a computer disk or file) that is an integral part of the printing industry is almost always provided by these operations. Processes used in printing include a variety of methods for transferring an image from a plate, screen, or computer file to a medium, such as paper, plastics, metal, textile articles, or wood. The most prominent of these methods entails the transfer of the image from a plate or screen to the medium through lithographic, gravure, screen or flexographic printing. Often a computer file is used to directly ''drive'' the printing mechanism to create the image or electrostatic and other types of equipment (digital or non-impact printing). Though printing and publishing can be carried out by the same unit (a newspaper, for example), it is less and less the case that these distinct activities are carried out in the same physical location. This division also includes the reproduction of recorded media, such as compact discs, video recordings, software on discs or tapes, records etc. This division excludes publishing activities (see section J).$$
